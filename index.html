            <!-- summary of the race -->
            <p><span class="lewis">Hamilton</span> led most of the race and appeared on course to win what would have
                been a record eighth World
                Drivers' Championship, having taken the lead at the start of the race at turn 1 on the first lap.
                However, <span class="max">Verstappen</span> was the eventual winner, overtaking <span
                    class="lewis">Hamilton</span> on the final lap after a controversial
                safety car restart in the last moments of the race. <mark>The FIA thus conducted an inquiry into the
                    race
                    which led to a restructuring of race control including the replacement of Michael Masi as race
                    director
                    and amendments to the safety car rules.</mark> That inquiry subsequently concluded that the race
                officials had
                misapplied the then-regulations due to human error, but confirmed the results.</p>


            <p><span class="max">Verstappen</span>'s win secured his first Formula One World Drivers' Championship of
                his career by eight points
                from <span class="lewis">Hamilton</span>, and Red Bull Racing's first since 2013. Mercedes won their
                eighth consecutive Formula One
                World Constructors' Championship, setting a new record. The Grand Prix was also the final race for 2007
                World Champion Kimi Räikkönen; the 42-year-old Finn retired from Formula One after a two-decade career
                spanning (a then record setting) 349 Grand Prix starts.</p>

            <p>On lap 53, a crash at turn 14 for Nicholas Latifi, who was fighting for position with Haas' Mick
                Schumacher and had dirty tyres after going off circuit at turn 9, brought out the safety car.
                <span class="lewis">Hamilton</span> again stayed out without pitting because he would have lost track
                position had the safety car
                period not ended, while <span class="max">Verstappen</span> pitted behind him for a fresh set of the
                softest available tyres.
                Pérez retired under the safety car due to oil pressure. After <span class="max">Verstappen</span>'s pit
                stop, he retained second,
                but with five lapped cars (those of Lando Norris, Fernando Alonso, Ocon, Charles Leclerc, and Sebastian
                Vettel) between himself and <span class="lewis">Hamilton</span> (in first). As the debris from Latifi's
                crash was being cleared by
                the race marshals, the lapped drivers were initially informed that they would not be permitted to
                overtake. On lap 57, Masi gave the direction that only the five cars between <span
                    class="lewis">Hamilton</span> and <span class="max">Verstappen</span>
                were to unlap themselves.
            </p>

            <p>Immediately after Vettel passed the safety car to join the lead lap, race control announced the safety
                car would enter the pits at the end of the lap to allow for a final lap of green-flag racing, leading to
                angry remonstrations from Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff. On the final lap, <span
                    class="max">Verstappen</span> used his
                fresh soft tyres to pass <span class="lewis">Hamilton</span> into turn 5 to take the lead of the race.
                He held off counter-attacks
                from <span class="lewis">Hamilton</span> to win the race and his first World Drivers' Championship, with
                <span class="lewis">Hamilton</span> in second and
                Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz Jr. in third. AlphaTauri driver Yuki Tsunoda finished in a career-best
                fourth place, after overtaking Bottas. Mercedes gained enough points to win their eighth consecutive
                Constructors' title, extending their own record. Over the radio, Wolff appealed to Masi to
                reinstate the order of the penultimate lap, to which Masi gave the reply: "Toto, it's called a motor
                race, ok? We went car racing."
